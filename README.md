# REINFORCEMENT_LEARNING_ALGORITHMS
Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a machine learning approach where an agent learns by interacting with an environment to maximize cumulative rewards. It uses states, actions, rewards, and policies to improve decision-making. Key algorithms include Q-learning, DQN, PPO, and A3C.
